Description : 'CRIXhnoptions provides a matrix that show the prices of
               Heston Nandi Put Options for different Strikes and different
               times to maturity. The prices are provided for CRIX and S&P500.
               Heston and Nandi proposed in their paper "A Closed-Form GARCH
               Option Valuation Model" a purely stock price based option 
               valuation model. Since for the CRIX doesn''t exist any options,
               the volatility can''t be computed from other options. This
               drawback requires an approach which works without option data.
               The prices of the S&P500 has been adjusted such that the last
               price is the same than for the CRIX. By this procedure, the 
               two time series become comparable for different Strikes and 
               Maturities.'
